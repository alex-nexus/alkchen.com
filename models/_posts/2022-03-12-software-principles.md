Below are some principles I learned over the course of my career: 

**1. Set up continuous deployment**

**2. Design Loosely coupled & Highly aligned teams and architecture**

**3. Conventions & processes > domain experts**

**4. 2-3 people is the best squad size**

**5. Choose moolithic architecture until scale or team size demands micro-services**

**6. Empowering tools > coupling collaborations**

**7. Design API contract before work begins**

**8. Simplicity > Completeness > Performance**

**9. Think about the future but code only for today**

**10. Write readable code like English**
  - A class has single responsibility 
  - Give functionS and variableS meaningful names

**11. Minimize coupling & dependencies > code reusability**

**12. Use hierarchy to reflect entity relations, and use modules to share behaviors**

**13. Hide complexity behind public functions**

**14. Use unit tests for radical refactoring**

**15. Reduce bugs by switching between developing (how) and testing (what) mode**

**16. Build core competency, buy technical commodities**
