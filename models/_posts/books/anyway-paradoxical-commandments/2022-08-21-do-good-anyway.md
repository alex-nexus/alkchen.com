### Introduction: Do Good Anyway

While going through book reviews I wrote a few years ago, I came across the review of Anyway: the Paradoxical Commandments by Kent M. Keith.

I really needed to be reminded of The 10 Paradoxical Commandments. This post is as much for me as it is for you. We (myself included) should never do things expecting gratitude or praise in return.

This year, 2020, has been a difficult one for most people. The global pandemic has forced most people to work remotely. Parents find themselves not only having to do their work, but they have had to also assume the role of teacher as well. The mental stress of isolation is taking its toll on many.

Race riots have added more tension to an already tense situation. It's a lot, and some might say, too much for any one person to bear. All you can do, is to do the best you can.

The World Economic Forum recently released its list of 10 skills you need to thrive up to 2025, and resilience, stress tolerance and control is on the list. In my own small way, I've hosted the Digest 30 Books in 30 Days Reading Makeover Challenge twice to help professionals get a pool of ideas to pivot their business and career. The idea of doing good anyway is very apropos for the times we're living in.

### The 10 Paradoxical Commandments

When Kent Keith was 19 years old, attending Harvard, he first wrote down the following 10 commandments in 1968. He published them in the booklet, The Silent Revolution: Dynamic Leadership in the Student Council.

1. People are illogical, unreasonable, and self-centered. Love them anyway.
2. If you do good, people will accuse you of selfish ulterior motives. Do good anyway.
3. If you are successful, you will win false friends and true enemies. Succeed anyway.
4. The good you do today will be forgotten tomorrow. Do good anyway.
5. Honesty and frankness make you vulnerable. Be honest and frank anyway.
6. The biggest men and women with the biggest ideas can be shot down by the smallest men and women with the smallest minds. Think big anyway.
7. People favor underdogs but follow only top dogs. Fight for a few underdogs anyway.
8. What you spend years building may be destroyed overnight. Build anyway.
9. People really need help but may attack you if you help them. Help people anyway.
10. Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you have anyway.

Since the time he first wrote down the 10 paradoxical commandments as a teenager, they've been cited by millions across the globe. A strong confirmation that the message resonates with many.

Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments: Finding Personal Meaning in a Cray World
First published in 2004, Kent Keith used Anyway: The Paradoxical Commandments to expand on what he first wrote in the 1960s. He presents his commandments and the philosophy behind each of them. Keith expands to give context, so you know where he's coming from.

The book tells you to do your best, even in difficult times. You cannot control the events happening around you. But you can control how you respond.

> “Give the world the best you have and you'll get kicked in the teeth. Give the world the best you have anyway,”

is very appropriate during these difficult times. The book tells us to focus on meaning and not on success. And to live by your values. The 10 Paradoxical Commandments are tenets to live by. If you've never sat down and gone through the process of discovering your value, now is the perfect time to do you.

### Conclusion: Anyway: The 10 Paradoxical Commandments: Finding Personal Meaning in a Crazy World

Anyway: The 10 Paradoxical Commandments is a timeless and worth the read. You'll find comfort in the words on the pages. If you have never read Anyway: the Paradoxical Commandments by Kent M. Keith, pick up a copy today. It's an easy read. The story is based on “The Paradoxical Commandments,” which was first written as a poem had hung on the wall of Mother Theresa‘s children's home in Calcutta, India.

Anyway: The 10 Paradoxical Commandments by Kent Keith reminds me of the Analects of Confucius and Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin. That's why I've grouped them together.
