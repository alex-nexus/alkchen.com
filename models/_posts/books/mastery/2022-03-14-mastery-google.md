description: Robert Greene stops by the Googleplex to discuss his latest book, "Mastery." Temple Grandin, Martha Graham, Henry Ford, Buckminster Fullerâ€”all have lessons to offer about how the love for doing one thing exceptionally well can lead to mastery. Yet the secret, Greene maintains, is already in our heads. Debunking long-held cultural myths, he demonstrates just how we, as humans, are hardwired for achievement and supremacy.
