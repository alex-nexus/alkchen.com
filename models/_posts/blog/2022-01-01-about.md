My name is Alex Chen. First of all, I am a husband and a father. 

Secondly, I practice my craft as a software engineer with over 15 years of experience. I am grateful that I actually find something I enjoy doing. I have the priveledge of working at the following great startups and public companies:
  - [Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/): A subscription-based and personalized shopping site for clothing and fashion. It went IPO.
  - [IPSY](https://www.ipsy.com/): Subscription to receive monthly bag of personalized beauty products. 3 millions subscribers that pay $10 / month. It hs close to $1 billion annual GMV and is profitable.
  - [One Kings Lane](https://www.onekingslane.com/): Flash site for high-end home decor / furniture. I was the first internal engineering hire. The year we launched the product, its reached $100M in annual GMV.

Upwork and Stitch Fix went IPO. 

Currently I am an engineering manager at Goodwater Capital, a VC with $2 billions AUM. You can read more about us at [here](https://www.goodwatercap.com/about/). At Goodwater Capital, we are different from typical VCs in 5 ways:

1. We use **big data** to learn and evaluate companies.
2. We build **internal software as a product** to standardize and speed up our investment process. 
3. We use **machine learning** to identify and priortize top companies using metrics
4. Our software engineers, data scientists, and product managers outnumer our investors.
