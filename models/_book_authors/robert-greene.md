introduction: Robert Greene is the author of the New York Times bestsellers The 48 Laws of Power, The Art of Seduction, The 33 Strategies of War, and The 50th Law.

In addition to having a strong following within the business world and a deep following in Washington, DC, Greeneâ€™s books are hailed by everyone from war historians to the biggest musicians in the industry (including Jay-Z and 50 Cent).
