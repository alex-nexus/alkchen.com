The Manager's jobs are accomplished by providing team members with three things:
  - Clear direction — not necessarily setting the direction themselves but ensuring that one is set.
  - Coaching to improve what’s not working, and to continue what’s working.
  - Career development — going beyond helping employees succeed in the job they’re doing right now, by helping them discover the long-term vision for their careers and showing them what actions they can take right now that will allow them to make tangible progress towards it.
