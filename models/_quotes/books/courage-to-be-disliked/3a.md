Past psychological trauma affects, but is not what determines a person's present and future life. What determines is the choice you make at the moment. You can only be happy when you live fully in the present moment without letting the worries of the past or the future affect you. You can only be completely happy when you live with a clear goal & are always in a state of continuous action towards the goal, right now.
