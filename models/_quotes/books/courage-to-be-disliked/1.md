Perspective 1

Instead of praise or reward, a better way to arouse real goodwill in children is for parents to talk about how they feel when their children do a good deed such as touched or happy and at the same time ask children feel on their own. Gradually, children will realize that they are valuable, they do good things because they feel comfortable and happy themselves, not because of praise or recognition of others.
