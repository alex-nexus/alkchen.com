What is it like to live in harmony with others?
It is that each person needs to be clearly aware of what is his or her duty and what is the duty of others. If it's someone else's job, then even if it's someone who has a close relationship like a husband and wife, parent-child, or soulmate, you should always let them solve the problem by themselves. You can observe, understand, then advise and support but absolutely should not interfere in the final decision. This is not irresponsibility, but respect for one's ability.
