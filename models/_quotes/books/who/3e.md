3. SELECT: IDENTIFY A-PLAYERS USING 4 INTERVIEWS

Only move someone to the next phase of the interview if youâ€™re truly excited about them and convinced that they could be the ideal candidate. After the 4 interviews, complete the scorecards and give each candidate an overall grade of A, B, or C. Only hire A-graders. If you have no A-graders, keep sourcing; if you have multiple A-graders then hire the best.
