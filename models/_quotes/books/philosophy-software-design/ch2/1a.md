Complexity typically manifests itself in a software project in three major ways ordered in terms of increasing severity:

  1. When a simple change requires modifying code in many places.
  2. When developers need to carry a lot of information in their heads to complete a task. This increases the chances that they might miss something, leading to bugs.
  3. When it is not obvious what information or changes are needed in order to carry out a task (unknown unknowns).
