When choosing a name, try to capture the essential purpose of the entity being named using as few words as possible. Generic names are not recommended in most cases because it increases the chances that the named entity will be misused. Itâ€™s also important to be consistent when using names, so that the same name means the same thing throughout the codebase regardless of the context in which it was used.
